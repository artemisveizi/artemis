I'm currently working on optimally validating silicon in Apple's Silicon Engineering Group. Here are some of my past projects:

#### Princeton Senior Thesis: <a href="https://artemisveizi.github.io/Veizi_Artemis_Thesis.pdf" target="_blank">Towards Machine Learning for Network Optimization: Buffer Sizing via Reinforcement Learning</a> 

I completed my undergraduate thesis in the ECE Department, under the guidance of Professor Maria Apostolaki in the NetSyn Lab at Princeton. 
We present a reinforcement learning algorithm to select optimal buﬀer thresholds, with the aim of developing a buﬀer management strategy which more dynamically responds to changes in network traﬃc. We use NS–3 (Network Simulator 3) to simulate diﬀerent network configurations with varying traﬃc loads, TCP protocols, and per-priority queue weights on a fixed topology, and compare our reinforcement learning algorithm (RLBM) to a statically-configured buﬀer management scheme (SB). Within a limited topological scope, simulation results indicate that RLBM produces the same or better throughput as SB in simulations with larger physical buﬀers. The RLBM scheme also showed significant improvement in the worst observed FCT slowdown and end-to-end delay for small buﬀer sizes. Our findings indicate that reinforcement learning algorithms could improve network performance over traditional buﬀer management schemes, and warrant further exploration of reinforcement learning solutions to the buﬀer management problem.

#### Some Fun Things!
[8-Puzzle Solver](https://github.com/artemisveizi/8puzzle-AI) Uses breadth-first search to solve 8 puzzles in the smallest number of moves possible.  
[N-Queens Solver](https://github.com/artemisveizi/nqueens-AI) The classic eight queens puzzle, extended to n queens: placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.  
[Word Ladder Solver](https://github.com/artemisveizi/wordladder-AI) Uses the Informed A* Search algorithm to find the shortest Levenshtein distance between two words in a given dictionary of valid words.  
[Othello Player](https://github.com/artemisveizi/othello-AI) Plays Othello (and will almost certainly beat all humans). Implements alpha-beta pruning to search the solution tree efficiently.
